Last week, I was able to use for the first time the Unity software. Like Blender, it allows one to create different models with their own movements and physics. 
The whole point of our lessons was to be able to create a kind of platformer mini-game where you would be controlling a character in Third-Person View. To do that, we learned how to create our platforms with the different meshes that are available in the game and then we focused on the physics of these object.
We learned how to give them a physical body which can react to gravity, friction and many different kind of forces. We also animated their visual representation to have some really good-looking platforms.
The main challenge in this lessons were to make the character playable and the solutions to that was the script method. We basically coded the different movements of the character based upon the inputs that we were giving and we coded a camera that would follow our little boy everywhere so that the player can always see evrything. The final step was to give 'life' to the character by adding some animation based on the input.
