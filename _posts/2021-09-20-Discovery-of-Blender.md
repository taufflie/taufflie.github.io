## Discovery of Blender

In this first blog, I will be talking the things I learned to do in Blender.

In Blender we learned all of the basics to create an animated characters and animated objects. We first discovered the different meshes that are available, then we tried to modify them as we wanted to give them the shape we wanted to. Using differents tools, we can add or substract volumes or surfaces to our object. 
After that, we went a bit deeper into how to make our model more realistic by adding colours and textures directly into the dedicated tab. 
The final step was to animate the object by using the key frames system and by using rotation and translation. 
In the end, I was able to obtain this result. I find it pretty cool.
