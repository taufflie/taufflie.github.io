## Blog Post Title From First Header

Due to a plugin called `jekyll-titles-from-headings` which is supported by GitHub Pages by default. The above header (in the markdown file) will be automatically used as the pages title.

If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.

This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.

### This is a header
Blog
#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```

In this first blog, I will be talking the things I learned to do in Blender.

In Blender we learned all of the basics to create an animated characters and animated objects. We first discovered the different meshes that are available, then we tried to modify them as we wanted to give them the shape we wanted to. Using differents tools, we can add or substract volumes or surfaces to our object. 
After that, we went a bit deeper into how to make our model more realistic by adding colours and textures directly into the dedicated tab. 
The final step was to animate the object by using the key frames system and by using rotation and translation. 
In the end, I was able to obtain this result. I find it pretty cool. 

See you next week.
